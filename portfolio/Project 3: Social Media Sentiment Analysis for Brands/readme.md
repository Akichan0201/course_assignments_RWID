- **Problem Solved:**  
  Companies need to monitor public sentiment to understand customer opinions and improve their brand reputation. This project collects user-generated content and processes it to determine overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

- **Challenges When Scraping:**  
  - **API Rate Limits:** Platforms like Twitter limit how many requests you can make, so you must plan for efficient data retrieval.  
  - **Unstructured Data:** Social media text is often noisy and unstructured, requiring advanced text processing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal).  
  - **Spam/Bots:** Filtering out non-genuine content can be challenging.

- **Deliverable:**  
  **Kaggle Notebook** â€“ Provide a well-documented notebook that demonstrates data extraction, cleaning, sentiment analysis using NLP libraries (such as NLTK or spaCy), and visualization of sentiment trends over time.

- **Additional Features:**  
  - Topic modeling to find common themes in user discussions.  
  - Interactive visualizations (using libraries like Plotly) that allow exploration of sentiment data.

- **Resources & References:**  
    - Include any references you used for this project. While not mandatory, adding references can greatly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your portfolio.
