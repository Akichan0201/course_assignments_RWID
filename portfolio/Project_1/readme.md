- **Problem Solved:**  
  Retailers need real-time data to compare their prices with competitors. By monitoring competitor prices, a business can adjust its own pricing strategy to remain competitive.

- **Challenges When Scraping:**  
  - **Dynamic Content:** Many e-commerce sites load data via JavaScript (AJAX). You may need tools like Selenium or Puppeteer to render pages before scraping.  
  - **Frequent Layout Changes:** Websites often update their design, which can break your scraping code. Your code should be modular and easy to update.  
  - **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Websites might block IPs, use CAPTCHAs, or require user-agent spoofing. Consider strategies like rotating proxies or using headless browsers.

- **Deliverable:**  
  **Web Dashboard** â€“ Create an interactive dashboard (using tools like Dash, Streamlit, or a custom web app) that displays price trends over time, highlights significant price changes, and provides options to export data.

- **Additional Features:**  
  - Integration with a predictive model to forecast future pricing trends.  
  - Notification system (via email or SMS) when competitors drop prices significantly.

- **Resources & References:**  
    - Include any references you used for this project. While not mandatory, adding references can greatly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your portfolio.
