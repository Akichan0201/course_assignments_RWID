## Web Scraping Don'ts
**1. Don’t Scrape Data Without Checking Legal & Ethical Boundaries** 
Before scraping, always check:  
✅ **Robots.txt** – contains instructions for web crawlers and bots, specifying which parts of a website they are allowed or disallowed to access and scrape.
✅ **Privacy Laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)** –  contain provisions that regulate how personal data can be collected, stored, and used, which directly impacts web scraping activities.

---

**2. Don’t Scrape Personal or Sensitive Data**  
Avoid collecting:  
❌ Usernames, passwords, or login credentials  
❌ Private emails or phone numbers  
❌ Medical records or financial data

Avoid websites:  
❌ Betting/Gambling Websites
❌ Adult Content Websites (Pornographic Sites)
❌ Payment Platforms

---
**3. Don’t Overload a Website’s Server**
Sending too many requests too fast can:  
❌ **Crash the website** (denial of service).  
❌ **Get your IP banned**.  
❌ **Harm the website owner’s business**.  

**Best Practice:**  
✅ Use time delays.
✅ Implement **rate limiting & exponential backoff**.  

---
**4. Don’t Ignore API Alternatives**
Many platforms provide **official APIs**, which are:  
✅ Legal & reliable  
✅ Faster and structured  
✅ Less likely to get blocked

**5. Don’t Scrape Paywalled or Copyrighted Content**
❌ Avoid scraping **premium articles**, **academic papers**, or **licensed content**.  
✅ Instead, check for **public datasets** or **official APIs**.
