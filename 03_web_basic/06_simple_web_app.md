# Simple Web App Project

This project involves replicating or improving a simple web app based on the provided screenshots. The app consists of the following pages:

- **Home Page**
- **About Page**
- **Contact Page**
- **Form Submission Page**

### Project Structure

The folder `preview_project_basic_web` contains the following screenshots:

- `home_page.png` - Screenshot of the Home Page.
- `about_page.png` - Screenshot of the About Page.
- `contact_page.png` - Screenshot of the Contact Page.
- `form_submission.png` - Screenshot of the Form Submission Page.

### Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>` or download it as a ZIP file.

2. **Setup the Project:**
   - If using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create separate `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files for each page.
   - You can use any text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) to write your code.

3. **Replicate the Screenshots:**
   - Start by replicating the layout of the pages based on the screenshots.
   - Pay attention to the overall structure, colors, and design elements.
   - Ensure that the navigation links between the pages work correctly (e.g., the "Home" link should navigate to the home page).

4. **Improve the Design (Optional):**
   - You are encouraged to improve the design by adding your own style or features. Some ideas for improvement:
     - Add a responsive design to make the app mobile-friendly.
     - Improve the form validation and error messages.
     - Add animations or transitions for smoother user experience.
     - Enhance the design with custom fonts, colors, or icons.

5. **Form Submission Page:**
   - Implement the form functionality so that users can submit their information.
   - If you are familiar with JavaScript or server-side programming, you can create a mock submission system (such as storing the data temporarily or sending an email).

6. **Testing:**
   - Test the pages to ensure all links, buttons, and forms are working correctly.
   - Ensure your website looks good on different screen sizes (responsive design).

7. **Submission:**
   - Once you've replicated and/or improved the app, submit your project by uploading the files to the course platform or sending them via email.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy:** How closely you replicated the design based on the screenshots.
- **Creativity:** Any improvements you made to the design or functionality.
- **Usability:** The functionality of the navigation, forms, and links.
- **Code Quality:** The structure and readability of your code.

Good luck, and have fun building your project!
