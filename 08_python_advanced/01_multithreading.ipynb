    "### What is ThreadPoolExecutor?\n",
    "`ThreadPoolExecutor` is a Python class in the `concurrent.futures` module that allows you to manage a pool of threads efficiently. It simplifies multithreading by allowing you to run multiple tasks concurrently, making it ideal for I/O-bound tasks like web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use ThreadPoolExecutor in Web Scraping?\n",
    "When web scraping, most of the time is spent waiting for server responses (I/O). Using `ThreadPoolExecutor` enables you to:\n",
    "- Scrape multiple pages concurrently.\n",
    "- Reduce overall execution time.\n",
    "- Use system resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simple example of using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to scrape multiple URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def scrape_page(url):\n",
    "    print(f\"Scraping: {url}\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)  # Simulates a delay for I/O-bound tasks\n",
    "    return f\"Data from {url}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "urls = [f\"https://example.com/page{i}\" for i in range(1, 6)]\n",
    "\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:  # 3 worker threads\n",
    "    results = list(executor.map(scrape_page, urls))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Scraping completed!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`max_workers=3`**: Creates 3 threads to scrape URLs concurrently.\n",
    "- **`executor.map()`**: Maps the `scrape_page` function to each URL in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Reduces execution time for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "- **Simple API**: Easy to use compared to manually managing threads.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handles many tasks efficiently by reusing threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---"
