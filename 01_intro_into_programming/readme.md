# **Syllabus: Fundamentals of Programming for Non-Programmers**  
**Objective:** To help students develop **problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and an understanding of core programming concepts** before learning a specific language.

## **Module 1: Introduction to Computational Thinking (Week 1-2)**  
### **Introduction:**  
Computers are powerful because they can solve complex problems quickly, but they donâ€™t "think" like humans. **Computational thinking** helps us break down problems so that computers can understand and process them efficiently. Learning to **think like a programmer** will make it easier to understand coding later.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **Decomposition** â€“ Breaking a large problem into smaller, manageable parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition** â€“ Finding similarities between problems.  
3. **Abstraction** â€“ Ignoring irrelevant details to focus on the main problem.  
4. **Algorithm Design** â€“ Creating step-by-step solutions.  

### **Example:**  
Think about making a cup of coffee. What are the steps?  
- Boil water  
- Add coffee powder  
- Pour water into the cup  
- Stir and serve  

This is an **algorithm** because it follows a **logical sequence of steps**.  

### **Critical Thinking & Research Questions:**  
1. What is computational thinking, and why is it important for programmers?  
2. How do engineers and software developers use decomposition to solve problems?  
3. What are some real-world examples where pattern recognition is applied in technology?  
4. Why is abstraction necessary when designing a solution? Can you give an example from daily life?  
5. What is the difference between an algorithm and a process?  
6. How do computers follow instructions differently than humans?  
7. What are some common mistakes people make when writing instructions for others?  
8. How can algorithmic thinking be applied in fields outside of computer science?  
9. Why do some problems require multiple solutions instead of a single best solution?  
10. How can you improve your problem-solving skills to think like a software engineer?

## **Module 2: Understanding Algorithms and Flowcharts (Week 3-4)**  
### **Introduction:**  
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem. Before we write code, we often use **flowcharts** to visually represent these steps. This makes it easier to understand and communicate the logic behind a solution.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is an algorithm?** â€“ A set of well-defined instructions.  
2. **Flowchart symbols and their meanings.**  
3. **Decision making in algorithms (IF-ELSE conditions).**  
4. **Loops and repetition in algorithms.**  

### **Example:**  
**Algorithm for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
1. Start  
2. Input a number  
3. If the number is divisible by 2, print "Even"  
4. Else, print "Odd"  
5. End  

**Flowchart Representation:**  
ðŸŸ¢ **Start** â†’ ðŸ”· **Input Number** â†’ ðŸ”² **Check If Number % 2 == 0** â†’ â¬œ "Even" / "Odd" â†’ ðŸ”´ **End**  

### **Critical Thinking & Research Questions:**  
1. What makes an algorithm efficient, and why does efficiency matter?  
2. What are the key differences between an algorithm and a program?  
3. How would you design an algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations?  
4. Can you think of an everyday task that can be represented as an algorithm? How would you write it?  
5. What are the main components of a flowchart, and how do they help in understanding algorithms?  
6. Find two different flowcharts for sorting numbers and compare their effectiveness.  
7. Why is decision-making (IF-ELSE conditions) important in algorithms?  
8. How would you modify a simple algorithm to handle unexpected errors or conditions?  
9. What are the differences between linear and non-linear algorithms? Provide examples.  
10. How can flowcharts help in debugging and understanding software systems?

## **Module 3: Introduction to Pseudocode and Logical Thinking (Week 5-6)**  
### **Introduction:**  
**Pseudocode** is a way of writing algorithms in plain English mixed with programming-like structures. It **doesnâ€™t follow the syntax of a real programming language** but helps programmers plan their logic before writing actual code.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is pseudocode?** â€“ A human-readable way to describe algorithms.  
2. **Basic pseudocode syntax (Variables, Loops, Conditionals).**  
3. **How pseudocode translates into real programming languages.**  

### **Example:**  
**Pseudocode for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
```
BEGIN  
   INPUT number  
   IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN  
      PRINT "Even"  
   ELSE  
      PRINT "Odd"  
   ENDIF  
END  
```

### **Critical Thinking & Research Questions:**  
1. Why is pseudocode useful before writing actual code in a programming language?  
2. How does pseudocode differ from real programming languages like Python or JavaScript?  
3. What are some best practices for writing clear and understandable pseudocode?  
4. What are the basic building blocks of pseudocode, and how do they map to real programming concepts?  
5. Given a simple task (e.g., checking if a number is even or odd), how would you write its pseudocode?  
6. How would you write pseudocode to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list?  
7. What is the difference between sequential execution, selection (IF-ELSE), and iteration (loops) in pseudocode?  
8. Why is indentation and structure important in pseudocode readability?  
9. How do you test pseudocode to check if it works before converting it into a real program?  
10. What challenges might arise when translating pseudocode into an actual programming language?

## **Module 4: Introduction to Data Structures and Problem Solving (Week 7-8)**  
### **Introduction:**  
Data structures help organize and store data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure is essential for solving problems effectively in software development.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What are data structures?** â€“ Ways to store and manage data.  
2. **Lists, arrays, and dictionaries.**  
3. **Sorting and searching algorithms.**  
4. **Problem-solving strategies using data structures.**  

### **Example:**  
**Problem: Find the largest number in a list.**  
**Algorithm:**  
1. Start  
2. Define a list of numbers  
3. Assume the first number is the largest  
4. Loop through the list and compare each number
